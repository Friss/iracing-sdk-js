**iracing-sdk-js** provides data access (live telemetry and session info) and most of the available commands. You can find some usage examples in the [examples](https://github.com/friss/iracing-sdk-js/tree/main/examples) directory, and there are some [data samples](https://github.com/friss/iracing-sdk-js/tree/main/sample-data) too.

Latest tested iRacing version: *2025 Season 4*

## Installing

Make sure you are running [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v21 x64 or later. (Currently requires Node 21 for latest node test runner implementation, but should work with Node 20 too.)

`yarn add iracing-sdk-js --save`
